## 🏗️ Technical Implementation

### **Architecture**
```
Authentication Flow:
1. User enters credentials → Login.razor
2. AuthService validates → MongoDB lookup
3. CustomAuthStateProvider stores session → ProtectedSessionStorage
4. NavMenu updates → Shows role-specific links
5. Protected pages enforce access → [Authorize] attributes
```

### **Key Files Modified**
```

## 📊 Codebase Analysis Results

### **Duplication Found**
- ⚠️ Two `AuthService` implementations (root vs RestaurantMS)
- ⚠️ Two user models (`User.cs` vs `ApplicationUser.cs`)
- ⚠️ Root-level Controllers/ not being used

### **Recommendation**
See `CODEBASE_ANALYSIS.md` for detailed consolidation plan.

**TL;DR:** Root-level code appears to be an old API attempt. RestaurantMS/ is the active project.
